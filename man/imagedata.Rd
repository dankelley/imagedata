\title{Digitize a linear-scale plot that is shown in a graphics window.}
\usage{
imagedata(image, xaxis, yaxis, rotated = FALSE, col = "red", pch = 20,
  cex = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{image}{name of image file (must be PNG)}

\item{xaxis}{values along the x axis, typically at tick marks}

\item{yaxis}{values along the y axis, typically at tick marks}

\item{rotated}{a logical indicating whether the axes are rotated}

\item{col}{colour of points, as for \code{\link{par}}}

\item{pch}{type of points, as for \code{\link{par}}}

\item{cex}{size of points, as for \code{\link{par}}}
}
\value{
\code{imagedata} returns a list containing \code{x} and \code{y} values, which are the
digitized points, \code{X} and \code{Y}, which are lists containing \code{a}
and \code{b} values that hold the axis transformations, \code{S}, a
list containing \code{x} and \code{y} defining the lower-left corner
of the STOP zone, and \code{U}, a list containing the \code{x} and \code{y}
defining the upper-right corner of the UNDO zone.
}
\description{
\code{imagedata}, the main function of the 'imagedata' package,  
digitizes points from images.  As of now, the images must
be in PNG format, and the axes must be linear. Also, at
least on OS X machines, the plot device type must be 
quartz, since x11 does not properly buffer text in the console
when combined with clicks in the plot window.
}
\details{
If \code{rotated} is TRUE, then the first step is to display the image
with a red diagonal line and red dotted horizontal and vertical lines,
inviting the user to click above or below the diagonal line to 
alter the rotation angle.  Any click that is to the left of the
centre of the image will end this step, storing the inferred angle.
The idea of this interactive method is to help in cases of flawed
documents, e.g. those created with a photocopier.

Then the user is asked to click somewhere at the bottom-left of 
image, to set up an "UNDO" zone, and then the top-right, to
set up a "STOP" zone. Normally these zones are placed outside
the axis; they only have to be large enough to be easily clicked
within.

Next, the user asked to click on the x axis, at values given
by the \code{xaxis} argument.  These values are normally at tick
marks.  The same is then done for the y axis.

Then it's time to digitize image data. If a mistake is made,
click in the UNDO zone. To stop digitizing, click in the STOP
zone.  The results of \code{imagedata} are a list, of which
the two most interesting components are \code{x} and \code{y},
the coordinates of the clicked points, translated to the 
coordinates of the plot (i.e. using the axis information).

# Create a PNG file
