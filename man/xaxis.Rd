\title{A helper function that compute 'xa' and 'xb' for the x axis.}
\usage{
xaxis(values, U = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{values}{a vector of values on the x axis, typically labelled ticks}

\item{U}{an "undo" list as returned by bottomleft().}
}
\value{
list containing 'a' and 'b', for the linear mapping, and 'angle'
}
\description{
xaxis takes a vector of values along the y axis (commonly at tick marks)
and instructs the user to click the indicate points.  It then calls
idlocator(n) with n set to the length of that vector, and uses lm() to
find a linear mapping between values and locations on the graphics
device.  The mapping is stored in global variables xa and xb.
